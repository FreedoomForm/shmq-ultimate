"""ISA-aware quanta matching (PolyQ-inspired).

PolyQ (https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.14618) introduces two key ideas:

1. **ISA-aware quanta matching**: round the SIZE of each precision cluster
   to a multiple of the underlying tensor-core tile size. On NVIDIA GPUs:
     * INT4  tensor cores operate on tiles of 64 columns  (m16n8k64 mma)
     * INT8  tensor cores operate on tiles of 128 columns (m16n8k32 mma)
     * FP16  tensor cores operate on tiles of 128 columns (m16n16k16 mma)
   Unaligned cluster boundaries force the kernel to emit masked or
   partial tiles, which on Hopper/Ampere costs 20-40% throughput.

2. **Layout propagation**: once the weight channels are permuted so that
   clusters are contiguous, the SAME permutation must be propagated
   through every operator that touches those channels — RMSNorm
   (absorbed into the weight), the next Linear's input (absorbed via
   weight row-permutation), and the KV-cache. We implement (1) here;
   (2) is handled in `permutation/decoupled.py` and `permutation/rmsnorm_fusion.py`.

The matching is done AFTER the per-channel sensitivity is computed but
BEFORE the decoupled permutation. We adjust the K boundary of each
cluster so that:

    |C_16| mod 128 == 0
    |C_8|  mod 128 == 0
    |C_4|  mod 64  == 0   (INT4 tile is 64 columns wide)

The adjustment prefers to move channels from the LOWER-precision cluster
to the HIGHER-precision cluster (since over-quantizing hurts more than
under-quantizing), but never violates the global memory budget.
